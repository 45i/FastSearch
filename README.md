# FastSearch 

# WTF is this??!! 
FastSearch is a python program that I'm currently working on.

# OK, what can it do?
It lets you search and obtain Information form WikiPedia, WikiHow and YouTube( WORK IN PROGRESS) and can generate search query links for Google, Bing and Pypi.org. Just added translation:)

# Tasks and TODO
[] Add All Possible Languages to the Translator
[] Fix the Youtube Searcher
